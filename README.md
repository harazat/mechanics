The FT class' transform method does not return anything, as the code is taken from the book, and the rest of the tasks are written in a way to have used the transofrm void method. 
Overall, all the methods are producing something:D being provided with a specific representation of the binary bits, there is a room for improvement, efficiency and better OOP strucutre. 
Thank you!
